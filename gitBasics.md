# Git Basics

This file has been made in order to teach me, and potentially others in how to use git in tandem with github effectively.



## Creating Local Git Repository

Find the folder that you want to use using 

```pseudocode
ls <!-- Views the list of files within current directory -->
cd dirName <!-- Changes directory to the directory of name specified -->
mk dirName <!-- Creates a directory in the current location of name specified -->
git init <!-- Initialises a repository in the current directory -->
```



Steps

* Locate/Create location of new repository
* Use 'git init' after changing directory to the location



## Adding a New File To The Repository
